This repository demonstrates a subtle type inference issue in TypeScript related to array concatenation. The `combine` function aims to concatenate two number arrays, but the TypeScript compiler doesn't accurately infer the return type when using the `concat` method.  The solution provides a corrected version using type assertions or generics to explicitly define the return type and address the type inference problem.
